Census Income Classification Project

Project Overview: Conducted data analysis on census income data to predict income levels using advanced machine learning methods.
Techniques Applied: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering. Implemented boosting techniques, including methods like Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, or XGBoost.
Key Achievements:
Improved model accuracy and interpretability through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
Utilized visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore patterns and validate model assumptions.
Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
